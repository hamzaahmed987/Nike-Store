# 🚀 **Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025**

✨ Welcome to **Day 2** of my **Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025** journey! On this exciting day, I transitioned from business-focused planning to technical preparation, designing a seamless system architecture and defining integrations between the frontend, backend, and third-party APIs. 🛠️

---

## 🛠️ **System Design Overview**

🎯 The system is designed to be **robust** and **scalable**, ensuring seamless interactions between components. The goal is to provide users with a **dynamic**, **user-friendly shopping experience** for a wide range of products, including **Nike shoes**. 👟

---

## 🎯 **Frontend-Backend Integration**

### **Frontend Framework:**
- Built with **Next.js** for dynamic server-side rendering and lightning-fast performance. ⚡
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern designs. 🎨
- State management handled via **Redux** for predictable and scalable data flow. 🔄

### **Backend:**
- Powered by **Sanity.io** CMS to manage product, order, and customer data. 📦
- RESTful APIs handle CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) efficiently. 🔗

### **Communication:**
- The **frontend** communicates with the backend through well-defined **HTTP requests** using API endpoints. 📡

---

## 🌐 **Third-Party API Integration**

### **Third-Party API Details:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Handle essential marketplace features such as **shipment tracking**, **secure payment processing**, and **real-time product availability**. 🚚💳

- **Integration Flow:**
  1. The **frontend** sends requests to the **backend**.
  2. The **backend** interacts with third-party APIs to fetch or process data.
  3. Results are sent back to the **frontend** for a seamless user experience. 🔄

- **Security:**
  - Ensure secure communication with **HTTPS** and **API key-based authentication**. 🔐

## 📊 **API Routes Definition**

| **Endpoint**          | **Method** | **Purpose**                            |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/api/products`       | GET        | Fetch a list of all available products. |
| `/api/order`          | POST       | Create a new order and process via the payment gateway. |
| `/api/order/:id`      | GET        | Retrieve details of a specific order by its ID. |
| `/api/order/:id`      | PUT        | Update the status of an order (e.g., shipped, delivered). |
| `/api/shipment`       | GET        | Track shipment status through the third-party API. |
| `/api/payment/verify` | GET        | Verify payment status securely.         |

## 💡 **Tech Stack**

🖥️ **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux

📦 **Backend:** Sanity.io

🌐 **API Integration:** Third-party APIs for payment and shipment tracking

🔒 **Authentication:** Secure login and transactions using robust authentication libraries

---

## 📃 **Documenting the Flow**

📂 **Data Flow:**
1. **Frontend:** Sends API requests to the backend for data retrieval or actions.
2. **Backend:** Processes these requests, interacts with the CMS or third-party APIs, and sends responses back.
3. **Frontend:** Dynamically updates the UI based on the received responses.

---

### 📊 **Data Structure Visualization**

🔗 The system handles these core entities:

- **Products:** ID, Name, Price, Stock, Description, Category.
- **Orders:** Order ID, Customer Info, Product Details, Status.
- **Customers:** ID, Name, Email, Address, Order History.
- **Vendors:** Vendor ID, Name, Contact Info, Product Listings.

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**

🔜 **Upcoming Tasks:**
1. Implement the planned **API routes**. 🛠️
2. Integrate **third-party services** for payment and shipment tracking. 🔗
3. Begin **frontend development** to connect all system components. 🌐

---

## 🚀 **Day 2 Summary**

✅ Today, I:
- Designed the **system architecture**.
- Outlined **data flow** between components.
- Planned **third-party API integrations**.

💡 These foundational steps bring me closer to creating a fully functional, scalable marketplace platform. Let’s build something amazing! ✨
